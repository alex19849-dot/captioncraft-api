<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<p>By using PostPoet, you agree to use the platform responsibly and for lawful purposes only.</p>

<p><strong>1. Service Nature</strong><br>
PostPoet generates text based on the information you provide. You remain fully responsible for how you publish, share, and use any captions generated. We do not guarantee performance, sales impact, or platform algorithm outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>2. PG Boundaries</strong><br>
PostPoet is designed to generate PG-13 safe content. Do not input explicit sexual content, hate speech, harassment, illegal activity, or anything abusive.</p>

<p><strong>3. Ownership & Rights</strong><br>
You own the rights to the captions you generate. PostPoet does not claim ownership over your generated text or your original descriptions.</p>

<p><strong>4. Limitations</strong><br>
Free plan users have a limited number of caption generations per day. The Pro plan removes these restrictions. Pricing may change as PostPoet grows.</p>

We may adjust, update, or modify PostPoet features, behaviour, or models at any time to improve performance or safety.</p>
