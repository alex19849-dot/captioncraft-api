<h1>About PostPoet</h1>

<p>PostPoet was built for the new era of digital creators, where storytelling and selling are no longer separate worlds. Whether you're posting lifestyle content, sharing personal moments, or dropping new products, captions shape how your audience connects with you.</p>

<p>Most AI caption tools are either cringe, overly salesy, or feel like generic filler text. PostPoet was designed to actually sound human, culturally aware, brand friendly and PG safe. No spam. No desperation. No influencer parody energy.</p>

<p>PostPoet takes your description, understands your creative intent, and writes captions that match your tone, your style, and your audience. It works for both creators AND sellers, because today's creator economy moves in both directions: content builds trust, trust drives sales.</p>

<p>Right now, PostPoet is in early release while we refine behaviour with real creators, small sellers, and resellers. You get 10 free captions a day on the free plan. The Pro plan removes limits.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning. PostPoet will continue expanding into smarter caption behaviours, auto niche tuning, product context boosters, and future multi-format generation.</p>

<p>Whether you're posting a night out, a flatlay drop, a product promo, or a quiet moment of reflection—PostPoet helps your words hit cleaner, faster, and with style.</p>

<p>Creators create culture. PostPoet helps make the words move with it.</p>
