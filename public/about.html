  <h1><strong>About PostPoet</strong></h1>

  <p>PostPoet was created for modern creators, sellers and storytellers who want clean, confident, culturally aware captions without the cringe or spam.</p>

  <p>Most AI caption tools sound robotic or overly sales driven. PostPoet was built to feel human, PG safe and tuned for creators and resellers who move fast.</p>

  <p>By blending your description, your chosen tone and (when used) your image, PostPoet produces captions that match your niche and audience. It works across lifestyle content, product drops, reselling, personal posts, branding and more.</p>

  <p>We are in early release while real users help shape tone tuning, image behaviour and caption quality. Free users get <strong>5 generations per day</strong>, and Pro members have unlimited access.</p>

  <p>This is only the start. Future updates will include tone intelligence, niche recognition, smarter product awareness and multi format generation.</p>

  <p>Creators set the culture. PostPoet helps your words move with it.</p>
